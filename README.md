# Ecocredit

Ecocredit is a web application that aims to help users reduce their carbon footprint and reward them with non-fungible tokens (NFTs) for their eco-friendly actions. The application is built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and uses blockchain technology to create and distribute NFTs.

## Features

- Users can sign up and create a profile that tracks their carbon emissions and savings based on their lifestyle choices and activities.
- Users can browse and join various challenges that encourage them to adopt more sustainable habits, such as using public transportation, recycling, planting trees, etc.
- Users can earn ecocredits for completing challenges and use them to redeem NFTs that represent their environmental impact and achievements.
- Users can view and manage their NFT collection, as well as trade them with other users on a marketplace.
- Users can also donate their ecocredits to support non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that work on environmental causes.
