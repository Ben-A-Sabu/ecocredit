                <b>Carbon footprint </b>is a term that describes how much greenhouse
                gas emissions are caused by a person, a product, an activity, or an
                organization. Greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane,
                trap heat in the atmosphere and contribute to global warming and
                climate change. The more greenhouse gases we emit, the larger our
                carbon footprint is. By measuring our carbon footprint, we can
                understand how our choices and actions affect the environment and find
                ways to reduce our impact.

            <div id="CarbonFootprintEffect" class="knowtext">
                The <b>effects</b> of carbon footprint are significant and alarming.
                They include global warming, climate change, melting ice caps, rising
                sea levels, extreme weather events, loss of biodiversity, and more.
                These effects threaten the health and well-being of humans and other
                living beings on the planet. Reducing carbon footprint is essential to
                prevent further damage and to protect the environment for future
                generations.

                - Use public transportation, bike, or walk instead of driving whenever
                possible. This will save you money on gas and <b>reduce</b> your
                emissions.<br />
                - Switch to renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, or hydro
                power. You can install solar panels on your roof, buy green
                electricity from your utility company, or invest in a renewable energy
                project. <br />- Eat less meat and more plant-based foods. Animal
                agriculture is a major source of greenhouse gases, especially methane.
                By eating more fruits, vegetables, grains, and legumes, you can lower
                your impact and improve your health.<br />- Buy local and organic
                products. This will reduce the transportation and packaging of your
                goods, which also emit greenhouse gases. Plus, you will support your
                local farmers and economy.<br />- Recycle and reuse as much as
                possible. This will reduce the amount of waste that goes to landfills,
                which also produce methane. You can also donate or sell your unwanted
                items instead of throwing them away.

            <div id="CarbonFootprint" class="knowtext">
                <b>Carbon credits</b> are a way of reducing greenhouse gas emissions
                and fighting climate change. They are certificates that represent the
                right to emit one tonne of carbon dioxide or equivalent gases. By
                buying and selling carbon credits, individuals and businesses can
                offset their own emissions or support projects that reduce emissions
                in other parts of the world. Carbon credits are an innovative and
                effective tool for promoting sustainable development and protecting
                the environment.

                The <b>effects</b> are they create incentives for clean energy and
                low-carbon technologies, such as wind, solar, hydro, and biomass.<br />
                - They promote sustainable development and social benefits in
                developing countries, such as poverty alleviation, health improvement,
                biodiversity conservation, and community empowerment.<br />
                - They increase awareness and responsibility among consumers and
                producers about their environmental impact and their role in
                mitigating climate change.<br />
                - They generate revenue and investment opportunities for governments
                and private sectors that can be used for environmental protection and
                adaptation measures.

                - Use renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, or hydro power.
                These sources do not emit any greenhouse gases and do not require any
                carbon credits. You can install them in your home or business, or buy
                green electricity from your utility company.<br />
                - Improve your energy efficiency by using LED lights, smart
                thermostats, insulation, and other devices that can help you save
                energy and money. You can also switch to electric vehicles or public
                transportation, which use less fuel and emit less carbon dioxide than
                conventional cars.<br />
                - Plant trees or support reforestation projects. Trees absorb carbon
                dioxide from the air and store it in their biomass. By planting trees
                or donating to organizations that do so, you can offset your emissions
                and earn carbon credits.<br />
                - Reduce your consumption of meat and dairy products. Animal
                agriculture is one of the major sources of greenhouse gas emissions
                and deforestation. By eating less meat and dairy, you can reduce your
                demand for these products and lower your carbon footprint.<br />
                - Educate yourself and others about climate change and its solutions.
                The more people know about the causes and effects of global warming,
                the more they will be motivated to take action and reduce their
                emissions. You can also join or support groups that advocate for
                climate justice and policy change.<br />

                        Oxfam is an anti-poverty organization that focuses on water and
                        sanitation, gender justice, conflicts and disasters, and much more.
                        Since 2015, the NGO has reached over 3 million people in Yemen with
                        services like clean water, sanitation, hygiene, and cash for food.
                        In Syria, where millions have been forcibly displaced since 2011,
                        Oxfam works in eight of the 14 governorates focusing on clean water,
                        hygiene kits, farmers, and more. Oxfam also has charity shops around
                        the world (most are in the UK) that sell donated and fair-trade
                        items. According to the 2020-2021 annual report, Oxfam reached over
                        14 million people with their COVID-19 response; worked with 1.7
                        million people on gender justice; and made USD 912 million in total

                        health, HIV/AIDS, malnutrition, vaccinations, mental health, and
                        more. They use 14% of their income on fundraising, 85% on programs,

                        BRAC is an international development NGO based in Bangladesh.
                        Because of how many employees it has, it’s the largest NGO in the
                        world. It works in every district in Bangladesh as well as in
                        countries like Kenya, Liberia, Afghanistan, and Myanmar. It focuses
                        on social development like microfinance, disaster risk management,
                        education, gender justice, and water and sanitation. BRAC also has
                        several social enterprises, which are self-sustaining, cause-driven
                        businesses. These help the NGO fund itself. According to its 2021
                        annual report, almost 2 in 5 people in Bangladesh received support
                        from BRAC. 11.5 million accessed financial services and awareness;
                        USD 4.5 billion in loans were disbursed; and 190,000 kids got access
                        to education. The NGO also had over 4 billion Taka in total assets.
